Project Overview:
Charlotte is a busy area with lots of events going on. It would be extremely convenient to have an all-in-one app for different organizations to host their events on and for users (people in the area) to see these events posted. Users would then be able to RSVP for certain events so that the organization can get an idea of the number of people to prepare for. 

The event planning web application was conceived to meet the demand for a streamlined way to organize and promote events within Charlotte NC. Many people, student groups, and small businesses face challenges when trying to engage their target audience and manage event logistics.

Current event management tools often cater to broader audiences without considering the specific needs of Charlotte NC. This project aims to bridge the gap by offering a platform that provides location-specific insights, personalized event recommendations, and easy to use RSVP tools. 

With this application, users will be able to create, manage, and promote their events more effectively, increasing community engagement and fostering a vibrant local event scene. The project not only seeks to address inefficiencies in current products but also to provide a tailored experience.
